Description:

Launch the game then you will be in the foyer. I have 15 rooms. 14 rooms are counted in the house and another one as the exit-forest. You cannot go to  forest without finding the key.

There are six ways for you to go in the house. North, south, west, east and upstair.

If you are in one room and you want to find what is in that room. There is a command search.

"the name of objects"-- to pick it up(ex: books). 

cook -- cook something in the kitchen.

unlock -- to open the box you find. There is a quiz for you to answer to get the things in the box. (answer: mile)

Sometime clojure is really confusing to me on some degree. I believe I can do a better game with more understanding on clojure. But it is very interesting to learn about such a language.
